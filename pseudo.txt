	go over each char in "retailer"
	
	points + 1 for each alphanumeric (a-z, 0-9)

* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.

	if "total" % 1 = 0

	if "total" decimal places are "00"

	points go up by 50

* 25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.

	if "total" %0.25 = 0

	if "total" decimal places are "00, 25, 50, 75"

	points go up by 25.

* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.

	( number of items / 2 floored ) * 5

	points go up by this number

* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the 
    price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of 
    points earned.

	strip leading and trailing whitespace

	if "shortDescription" stripped length % 3 = 0

	points go up by "price" * 0.2 rounded up (ceil)

* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.

	if "purchaseDate" last two numbers are odd % 2 = 1

	points go up by 6

* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
